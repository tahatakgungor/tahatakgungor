I am continuing my undergraduate education at Adana Alparslan Türkeş University of Science and Technology,
Faculty of Engineering, Department of Computer Engineering.

In addition to the theoretical knowledge I have gained throughout my education life, I have developed myself by
implementing projects in various fields. Also, I am always open to development.

In my career, I will always be someone who pursues knowledge, constantly researches and achieves its goals. My
most important and only goal will be to support the national struggle to reduce the foreign dependency of our
country and to be able to work in this field.
